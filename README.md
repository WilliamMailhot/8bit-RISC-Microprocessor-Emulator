**TIME:** Around 4 hours.

This challenge took me a bit longer than the other ones because I hadn't read the documentation correctly (Lesson learned: always reread the docs !)


**Steps:** This challenge is pretty self-explanatory, the goal was to emulate this "EMU 2.0 8bit RISC Microprocessor" using the docs and then run the provided ROM with it. 


**Overall feelings:** Was very fun to have emulating challenges this year. I hope we will get more next year !

**FLAG:** X-MAS{S4nt4_U5e5_An_Emu_2.0_M4ch1n3}
