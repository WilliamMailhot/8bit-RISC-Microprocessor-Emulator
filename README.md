**Context:** Solution to a challenge that took place during the XMAS-2019 CTF.


**TIME:** Around 4 hours.

This challenge took me a bit longer than the other ones because I hadn't read the documentation correctly (Lesson learned: always reread the docs !)


**Steps:** The challenge is pretty self-explanatory, the goal was to emulate this "EMU 2.0 8bit RISC Microprocessor" and run the provided ROM.


**Overall feelings:** The challenge included many caveats in the documentation making the challenge tedious to complete. Overall, it was nice to have an emulation challenge this year.

**FLAG:** X-MAS{S4nt4_U5e5_An_Emu_2.0_M4ch1n3}
